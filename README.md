# Anon
Turn your ideas into production-ready Arweave dApps via plain text messages.

## 🤔 What is Anon?

Anon is like having a coding buddy who never gets tired and knows everything about building apps. Instead of spending weeks learning complex programming languages, you can simply chat with Anon in plain English about what you want to build, and it creates the code for you.

Think of it as ChatGPT, but specifically designed for building web applications that live forever on the blockchain. Whether you want to create a simple website, a complex web app, or even a decentralized application (dApp), Anon makes it possible without needing to be a professional developer.

### 🧑🏻‍🍳 How It Works

1. **Start a Conversation**: Tell Anon what you want to build in normal language
   - "Create a todo app with a dark theme"
   - "Build a portfolio website with my projects"
   - "Make a simple game where users can collect points"

2. **Watch the Magic**: Anon understands your request and writes the code automatically
   - It creates all the necessary files
   - Designs a beautiful user interface
   - Adds functionality that actually works

3. **See It Live**: Your app appears instantly in a live preview
   - No setup required - everything runs in your browser
   - Make changes by talking to Anon
   - Test your app immediately

4. **Deploy Forever**: When you're happy, publish your app to Arweave
   - No monthly hosting fees
   - Truly decentralized and censorship-resistant
   - Your app becomes permanently accessible on the internet

You don't need to know React, HTML, CSS, or any programming language. Just describe what you want, and Anon builds it for you. It's like having a full development team in your pocket.
